## Usage

### For the GM

The module works automatically once enabled. When you pause or unpause the game using Foundry's pause controls:

1. **Pause the game**: Use the pause button in Foundry's interface or press the pause key
2. **Smooth transition**: The pause overlay will appear with your chosen transition effect
3. **Unpause the game**: The overlay will disappear with the same smooth transition
4. **Sound feedback**: If configured, a sound will play when pausing

### For players

Players don't need to do anything! The transitions will automatically apply when the GM pauses or unpauses the game. All players will see the same smooth transitions.

## Settings

The module offers several configurable settings accessible through the module settings panel:

- **Transition duration**: Duration of the pause/unpause transition
- **Transition template**: Choose from different transition effects (pop-in, pop-out, zoom-in, zoom-out, fade, blur, slide from left/right/top/bottom)
- **Full-screen background overlay opacity**: Opacity of the overlay when the game is paused
- **Full-screen background overlay color**: Color of the overlay when the game is paused
- **Pause sound**: Optional sound file to play when pausing the game
- **Pause sound volume**: Volume of the pause sound

## Compatibility
